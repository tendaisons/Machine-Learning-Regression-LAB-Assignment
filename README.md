AI Assignment QUESTIONS

1. Linear Regression:
Question 1:
Dataset: Simple Linear Regression You are given a dataset containing the number
of hours students spend studying and their corresponding exam scores. Implement a
simple linear regression model to predict the exam scores based on the number of
hours studied. Evaluate the model and interpret the coefficients.

2. Multiple Regression:
Question 2:
Dataset: Multiple Linear Regression Consider a dataset with information on a
person&#39;s age, income, and education level. Design a multiple linear regression model
to predict the person&#39;s spending habits. Evaluate the model&#39;s performance and
discuss the significance of each feature.
3. Polynomial Regression:

Question 3:
Dataset: Polynomial Regression You are provided with a dataset describing the
relationship between temperature and ice cream sales. Implement a polynomial
regression model to capture the non-linear patterns in the data. Experiment with
different polynomial degrees and choose the best model. Discuss the trade-offs
involved.

4. Linear Regression:
Question 4:
Dataset: Simple Linear Regression with Outliers Analyze a dataset containing
outliers in the relationship between the number of years of experience and salary.
Apply a robust linear regression model to handle outliers and evaluate its
performance compared to a standard linear regression model.

5. Multiple Regression:
Question 5:
Dataset: Multiple Linear Regression with Categorical Variables Explore a
dataset involving house prices with features like square footage, number of
bedrooms, and neighborhood (categorical). Build a multiple regression model that
incorporates categorical variables. Evaluate the model&#39;s accuracy and interpret the
results.

6. Polynomial Regression:
Question 6:
Dataset: Non-Linear Trend in Stock Prices Given a dataset on stock prices over
time, apply polynomial regression to capture non-linear trends. Analyze the
performance of different polynomial degrees and discuss the implications for
predicting future stock prices.

7. Linear Regression:
Question 7:
Dataset: Time Series Analysis Consider a time series dataset representing
monthly sales of a product. Implement a linear regression model to predict future
sales based on historical data. Evaluate the model&#39;s accuracy and discuss any
limitations in time series forecasting using regression.

8. Multiple Regression:
Question 8:
Dataset: Predicting Car Prices Build a multiple regression model to predict car
prices based on features such as horsepower, fuel efficiency, and brand reputation.
Evaluate the model and discuss the impact of each feature on the predicted car
prices.

9. Polynomial Regression:
Question 9:
Dataset: Population Growth Given a dataset on population growth over the years,
implement a polynomial regression model to capture the changing growth patterns.
Discuss the choice of polynomial degree and its implications for predicting future
population sizes.

10. Linear Regression:
Question 10:
Dataset: Simple Linear Regression with Missing Values Handle missing values in
a dataset that relates the number of miles people commute to work and the
frequency of public transportation usage. Apply a linear regression model after
addressing missing data and assess its predictive performance. Discuss the
strategies used for handling missing values.
